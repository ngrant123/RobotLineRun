Code that makes a robot follow a black line in continuous fashion

The purpose of this code is so that when downloaded into a NXT lego robot that is shaped in a car formation, 
it would be able to follow a black line on a white background continuously until it reaches a red line. 
The way that it does this is a combination of both the code and the sensors placed in the front of the robot. 
In front of it are three sensors which help guide the robot around the grid. Two of them are light sensors and 
one is a color sensor which causes the robot to stop on the red line. The code is coded in a language called
RobotC and is fairly easy to understand.
